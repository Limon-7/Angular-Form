    "### 1: How angular works?\n",
    "1. `Development Server Starts`:By running ng serve, Angular's development server is started, and it listens for requests on `localhost:4200`\n",
    "2. `Initialize Request`: The browser requests localhost:4200.\n",
    "3. `Application Shell`: Try to load `index.html` which includes a base tag that tells angular the base url for routing. Ex:`<app-root><app-root/>`\n",
    "   - download javascript bundles that contains all necessary scripts and file to run angular app.\n",
    "4. `Bootstraping`: After downloading, angular's runtime environment initialize the request.\n",
    "   - Compiling and initializing the root module `(AppModule)`.\n",
    "   - The AppComponent is bootstrapped, and its template is rendered inside the `<app-root>`tag in `index.html`.\n",
    "5. `Routing:` Routing directs to the appropriate component, if necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2: What is Module?\n",
    "Modules are `logical boundaries` in your application and the application is divided into separate modules to `separate the functionality` of your application.\n",
    "```typescript\n",
    "    import { NgModule }      from '@angular/core';\n",
    "    import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';\n",
    "    import { AppComponent }  from './app.component';\n",

    "    bootstrap: [ AppComponent ]\n",
    "    })\n",
    "    export class AppModule { }\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. `declarations` - Declare views(`components, directives, and pipes`) to make them privately available in this module.\n",
    "2. `exports` - Makes the declared view(`components, directives, and pipes`) public so they can be used by other modules.\n",
    "3. `imports` - This is where you import other `modules`.\n",
    "4. `providers` - Defines services that can be injected into this `module’s views`.\n",
    "5. `bootstrap` - The component that angular should load, when this Angular Module loads. The component must be part of this module.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3:What are the key components of angular?\n",
    "1. `Component`: Components are the building blocks of an Angular application that control `views` (HTML) and `logic` for a specific part of the UI.\n",
    "2. `Module`: Modules are `logical boundaries` in your application and the application is divided into separate modules to `separate the functionality` of your application.\n",
    "3. `Template`: Templates define the HTML structure and layout of a component.\n",
    "4. `Services`: Angular services are a `signleton object` and a way to `share data and logic` across application..\n",
    "5. `Metadata`: This can be used to add more data to an Angular class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4: Decorator\n",
    "With decorators we can `configure and customise our classes at design time`. It is implemented as functions.\n",
    "- **Class Decorators**: `@Component,@Injectable, @Pipe @Directive and @NgModule`\n",
    "- **Property Decorators**: `@Input` and `@Output` (These two decorators are used inside a class)\n",
    "- **Method Decorators**: `@HostListener` (This decorator is used for methods inside a class like a click, mouse hover, etc.)\n",

    "Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern used in Angular to supply objects (dependencies) to components, services, or directives instead of creating them manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Provider**: A provider is a congigurtaion that tells angular how to `create, retrive, or inject` a dependency.\n",
    "2. **Injector**: An injector is a DI mechanism responsible for `managing and resolving dependencie`.\n",
    "   - Finds or create an instance of a dependency when requested.\n",
    "   - Uses the `provider configuration` to determine how to resolve dependencies.\n",
    "3. **Toke/DI Token**: A token is an identifier that Angular uses to retrive a dependency from the `injector`.\n"

    "### 1:How DI works?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Registration**: A provider registers the dependency in the Angular injector system.\n",
    "2. **Request**: When a component or service requests a dependency, Angular starts at the nearest injector (component/module/root).\n",
    "3. **Resolution**: Angular resolves the dependency from the provider, using the rules defined (useClass, useFactory, etc.).\n",
    "4. **Injection**: The resolved instance is injected into the requesting class.\n",

    "\n",
    "A provider is a congigurtaion that tells angular how to `create, retrive, or inject` a dependency.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Class Provider**: use to instantiate a provided class `[{ provide: Logger, useClass: Logger }]`.\n",
    "2. **Value Provider**: `useValue` - provides a static value that should be used as a dependency.\n",
    "   - Useful for providing configuration and constant.\n",
    "   ```js\n",
    "      { provide: ConfigToken, useValue: { apiUrl: 'https://api.example.com' } },\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "3. **Factory Provider**:`useFactory` - allows you to define a function that constructs a dependency at runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Services requrie initialization based on runtime condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "     ```js\n",
    "     const heroServiceFactory = (logger: Logger, userService: UserService) =>\n",

    "     };\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `deps`: `deps` property is an array of provider tokens. The injector resolves these tokens and injects the corresponding services into the matching `heroServiceFactory` factory function parameters, based on the `order specified`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Existing Provider**: `useExisting` - allows you to alias a token and reference any existing one.\n",
    "   ```js\n",
    "   providers: [\n",
    "     NewLogger,\n",
    "     // Alias OldLogger w/ reference to NewLogger\n",
    "     { provide: OldLogger, useExisting: NewLogger },\n",
    "   ];\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "5. **multi: true** This flag is used when multiple providers for the same token.\n",
    "   - token will provide a collection of instances or values.\n",
    "   - used for creating a pipeline of actions that should be execute in a sequence. Ex: `HttpInterceptors, AuthGurad`\n",

    "### 5:How many ways can we consume DI?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Constructor Injection (Recommended)**: The dependency is injected into a class's constructor.\n",
    "2. **inject() Function**: Useful in scenarios like standalone functions or factory providers.\n",
    "3. **Injector Class**: For manual dependency resolution\n",
    "4. **Optional Dependencies** Use the `@Optional()`decorator to allow a dependency to be null if it's not provided.\n",

    "The Injector Tree is a hierarchical structure that Angular uses to manage dependency injection (DI).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Root Injector**:\n",
    "   - Angular creates a **single root injector** for the entire application.\n",
    "   - Services provided with `providedIn: 'root'` or declared in the providers array of the AppModule are part of the root injector.\n",
    "   - These services are singletons and shared across the entire application.\n",
    "2. **Module-Level Injectors**:\n",
    "   - Modules can define their own injectors using the providers array in the @NgModule decorator.\n",
    "   - Services provided here are scoped to the module and shared across all components in that module.\n",
    "3. **Component-Level Injectors**:\n",
    "   - Components can have their own injectors using the providers array in the @Component decorator.\n",
    "   - Services provided at this level are scoped to the component and its children.\n",
    "   - Non-Tree-Shakable\n",
    "4. **Resolution Strategy**:\n",
    "   - When a dependency is requested, Angular looks for the provider in the closest injector first.\n",
    "   - If the provider is not found, Angular traverses up the tree, checking parent injectors, until it reaches the root injector.\n",
    "   - If no matching provider is found, Angular throws an error.\n",

    "### 7:Tree-Shakable vs Non Tree-Shakable\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Tree-Shakable: Tree-shakable code is designed in a way that allows build tools (like Webpack or Rollup) to easily identify and remove any unused code (also known as \"dead code\") from the final output bundle. This helps reduce the bundle size and improve performance.\n",
    "2. Non-Tree-Shakable: Non tree-shakable code is not optimized for removal of unused code, which can lead to larger bundle sizes and potential performance issues.\n",
